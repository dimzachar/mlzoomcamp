# Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning (ML) is a process of extracting patterns from data, which is of two types:

features (information about the object) 
targets (correct predictions)

A model is a "description of statistical patterns" that predicts a target given some input. 
Models are trained with algorithms that take some input features as well as reference targets for those features.
