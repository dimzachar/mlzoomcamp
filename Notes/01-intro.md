## Introduction to Data Science

**Data science** is an interdisciplinary field that brings together methods and techniques from many fields, including statistics, mathematics, computer science.

The process starts with acquiring data, followed by cleaning the data, extracting features or variables from the cleaned dataset, modeling the data using machine learning algorithms, and finally evaluating the model performance on a set of test datasets.

Next, models are created using machine learning algorithms and evaluated on a set of test datasets.

**Data analysis** is the process of interpreting raw data to identify any possible problems, before making predictions. Summarizing the findings is also important to have an overview that can be communicated to other people.

**Machine learning (ML)** is a subset of data science that uses algorithms to extract patterns from datasets and then uses those patterns for prediction.

- Features are the characteristics of data that we have identified
- In order to make predictions, a target must be selected
- A model is a description of patterns in the data and how they relate to one another. It can be used to predict the outcome of an event, given some inputs
    - To generate a model, we take in some input features and find a target such as the expected output.
    - Algorithms extract patterns by using an error margin. Those patterns are then stored in the model

Once you train a model, it can process new original input and predict the target for the input's features.
