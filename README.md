# ML Zoomcamp 2022

This project is a commitment to study and understand machine learning.

As part of this challenge, I'll be working on code and projects from the the online course [ML Zoomcamp 2022](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp), which can be found
in this repository.

I will try to share my progress in [log.md](log.md) and on different social media.
[Notion]() will be my default journal.
